>## What is the use of CSS?

>-  CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts
-  CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice and on Braille-based, tactile devices.
-  CSS can also be used to allow the web page to display differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed.
-  The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
